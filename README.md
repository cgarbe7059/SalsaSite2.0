# salsa-site 2.0
For this project I wanted to create a site that displayed my love for Graphic Design and new KNowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This idea came from a fun hobby we have of making our own salsa at home from our garden. This is a storefrot site that is included with a homepage, shope page with functioning buttons that add's subtotals and submits to an entertaining order confirmation page. There is also a contact form that the user can enter and recieve another fun prompt. I really look forward on expanding on some of the ideas I had for this site in Web Development 2. Thank you for your time.
